Modern systems that solve the problem of extracting named entities differ from the models presented in modern benchmarks in that they use several approaches simultaneously to achieve high accuracy: compiling a reference, referring to knowledge bases, etc. This approach allows to expand the application of the model or to eliminate the main drawbacks. 

Based on the above-mentioned approach, a method for automatic collection of data from open sources was developed, which allows to prepare a neural network model to solve narrow problems with a minimum input set of parameters using the supervised systems. When developing the algorithm, the most general designs, not oriented to a specific task, were applied, and the minimum technical requirements allow to use it on computers with non-premium components.
